"""Publishing a Hyperview release: signing it, and putting it on GitHub.

Runs on the publisher's own computer, beside the signing key, because the key
never goes anywhere else. Standard library plus `cryptography` for Ed25519.

`release` is the whole thing in one command: tests, build, sign, upload,
publish. The three commands above it are its parts, for when one of them has
to be done on its own.
    python3 publish.py make-key    --name excalibur-plugins-2026 --out plugin-signing.key
    python3 publish.py sign-plugin --key plugin-signing.key --id mesafab-estimating \\
                                --version 1.0.0 --name "Mesa Fab Estimating" \\
                                mesafab_estimating.wasm

A release goes up as `preview` first — a GitHub prerelease, which only an
office set to "get them early" takes — and is promoted to `stable` once it has
been tried. The channel is part of what is signed, so promoting re-signs the
manifest; the program files themselves do not change.

The signed text must match `hub::update::Release::signing_payload` byte for
byte. There is a test in the Rust code that checks a manifest this script made.

An Excalibur View Office license is signed with the same key too, into a
`.evlicense` file the customer adds under Studio -> Office -> License. Its
signed text starts with a different first line from a release's, so one can
never pass for the other, and must match `hub::license::License::signing_payload`:

    python3 publish.py sign-license --key hyperview-signing.key \\
                                --company "Acme Steel, Inc." --users 6 --years 1
    python3 publish.py sign-license --key hyperview-signing.key \\
                                --company "Mesa Fab, Inc." --founding
    python3 publish.py sign-license --key hyperview-signing.key --product citadel \\
                                --company "Arc Valley Construction" --founding

A plugin is signed into a `.hvplugin` file that an office administrator adds
from the Plugins menu. Its signed text must match `plugin_api::signing_payload`,
and a test in the Rust code checks a plugin this script sealed. Sign plugins
with a key made for plugins alone (`make-key`, then its public half pasted into
PLUGIN_KEYS in trust.rs), not the release key: a plugin key can seal a plugin
and nothing else, so it can be used as often as plugins need signing.

---

**ExcaliburView.exe**: the desktop app. Double-click it on each computer. It installs itself for that person, opens, and finds the office's server by itself.

**ExcaliburView-Server.exe**: the Office server. Double-click it once on the computer that should hold the company's drawings. Windows asks for permission once. After that it runs by itself, and keeps itself and every copy of Excalibur View in the office up to date.

**ExcaliburView-mac.dmg**: the Mac version. Open it and drag Excalibur View into Applications. It is the whole program, not a viewer — Apple Silicon and Intel in one download.

The first person to open Excalibur View after the server is up sets it up and gets a join code for everybody else."""
