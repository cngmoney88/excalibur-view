"""Selling Excalibur View Office through Square, from the publisher's own PC.

Square takes the money. A license can only be made here, beside the signing
key, so this script is the bridge: it makes the payment links the website's
Buy buttons point at, and it turns paid orders into signed `.evlicense`
files with a ready-to-send email.

Nothing about a customer is kept anywhere but this computer, and the key is
never sent anywhere.

    python square.py setup                 make (or update) the payment links
    python square.py orders                what has been paid, and what is issued
    python square.py issue                 sign a license for each new order
    python square.py watch                 the same, quietly, for a scheduled task

Beside the signing key it expects:

    square-token.txt    a Square access token (Developer Console -> your app).
                        Permissions: PAYMENTS_READ, ORDERS_READ, ORDERS_WRITE,
                        PAYMENTS_WRITE, MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ.
    square-links.json   written by `setup`: every payment link it has made.
    square-site.json    written by `setup`: the settings to paste into the
                        website's site.json.
    square-orders.json  written by `issue`: which payments already have a
                        license, so nobody is ever charged into two of them.
    licenses/           where the .evlicense files and their emails land.

`issue` never guesses a company name. Square asks the buyer for it at
checkout; if the answer does not come back with the order, that order waits
and says so, and one command with `--company` finishes it.
