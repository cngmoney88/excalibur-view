//! The one thing the whole six-seat plan rides on: a seat finding the server
//! without anybody typing an address.
//!
//! The instruction this was built to was plain — put one thing on the server,
//! run it, and the other computers connect. Everything else in this program
//! can be worked around by typing a URL; this cannot, because the whole point
//! is that nobody has to. It is also exactly the sort of thing that breaks
//! silently: a refactor moves a port, or stops spawning a thread, and every
//! other test still passes while the office quietly stops finding its own
//! server.
//!
//! # Why this is one long test rather than six short ones
//!
//! The announcing socket is a single fixed port held for the life of the
//! process, which is right for a server and awkward for a test binary: only
//! the first server in the process can have it, and the rest would be testing
//! the first one's answers. So there is one server here and one test, told in
//! order, and the ordering is the point — the middle of it is a server being
//! set up *while somebody is looking at it*, which is exactly what happens on
//! the first morning.
