//! The audit log: who reached which drawing, and when.
//!
//! An office handling Controlled Unclassified Information is asked by an
//! auditor to show exactly this, and "we don't keep that" is not an answer
//! that passes. NIST SP 800-171's audit and accountability family wants
//! records that let you trace an action to the person who took it, and wants
//! them retained and reviewable.
//!
//! **What is recorded** is reaching and changing: signing in and failing to,
//! opening or downloading a drawing set, exporting a takeoff, adding or
//! removing people, changing what a person may do, adding a license, taking a
//! key. **What is not recorded** is every markup as it is drawn. A log nobody
//! can read is a log nobody reads, and the markups are themselves already a
//! signed record of who drew what.
//!
//! **Append only.** Nothing in the program edits or deletes a row. Whoever
//! administers the machine can of course reach the database directly; that is
//! true of every log ever kept, and is the reason an auditor asks who
//! administers the machine rather than trusting the software.
//!
//! The log lives on the office's own server with everything else. It is never
//! sent anywhere, sealed or not.
