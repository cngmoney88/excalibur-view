-- What happened on this server, and who did it. Kept because an office

-- which is the property that makes it worth anything. Whoever administers the
-- machine can of course reach the database - that is true of every log there
-- has ever been, and is why an auditor asks who administers the machine.
--
-- `person` is kept as the id and the email as it read at the time, so a row
-- still says who did it after somebody leaves and their account is removed.
-- An invitation: one code, for one person, used once.
--
-- The join code is one server-wide secret that names nobody, never expires
-- and is not used up. An invitation is the opposite of all four: it names who
-- it is for, it carries the role they will get, it stops working on a date,
-- and using it kills it.
--
-- No email is sent, and none ever will be. Sending mail means an SMTP server,
-- a sending reputation, a bounce nobody sees and a support call when a shop's
-- spam filter eats it. An administrator already has a way to reach the person
-- they are inviting -- they work together. What they need is something to
-- send, not something to send it with.
