//! Keeping a company's Hyperview up to date without anybody there doing it.
//!
//! Every half hour, and whenever a seat asks and the last look is ten minutes
//! old, the server asks the publisher's feed what the newest release is. A
//! new viewer is downloaded once, checked against the keys compiled into this
//! server, and offered to every seat in the office, each of which checks it
//! again for itself before it installs. A new server replaces this one and the
//! service manager starts it again a few seconds later.
//!
//! Two things an administrator decides, and nothing else does:
//!
//! - **Early or not.** An office on the early channel gets releases the
//!   publisher is still trying — which is how a new version reaches Mesa Fab
//!   before it reaches anybody else.
//! - **Held.** A pin holds every seat on one version while a bid goes out.
//!   The feed is still read; nothing is offered past the pin.
//!
//! What this never does is decide a build is trustworthy on the feed's say-so.
//! The signature is checked here, and again on every seat.
