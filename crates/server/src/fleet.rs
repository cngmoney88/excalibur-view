//! The channel the Excalibur Fleet talks to a shop's server on.
//!
//! Deliberately not part of `/api/v1`. That is the product's API — documented,
//! versioned, and the thing a customer's ERP integrates against. This is
//! something else: the small maintenance surface one shop's server offers to
//! whoever looks after it, shaped so the Fleet can watch and feed a Hyperview
//! installation exactly as it watches and feeds an Arc Valley one, with no
//! per-product code in the Fleet at all.
//!
//! Four things, on the paths the Fleet already asks for:
//!
//! - `GET  /api/version` — public. What this server is running.
//! - `GET  /api/admin/ops` — key-gated. The 6am questions: when were the
//!   drawings last copied off this box, how much disk is left, is the update
//!   channel still refusing unsigned builds.
//! - `GET  /api/admin/logtail` — key-gated. The server's own log, clamped.
//! - `GET  /api/admin/presence` — key-gated. Who is connected: the seats this
//!   process has served lately, bounded and read-only (`crate::presence`), in
//!   the same wire shape Arc Valley answers with, so the Fleet's Devices view
//!   works here without a line of per-product code.
//! - `POST /api/admin/update` — key-gated. A signed release, delivered
//!   verbatim.
//! - `POST /api/admin/update/rollback` — key-gated. Put the office back.
//!
//! **The Fleet cannot mint a build.** What arrives at `/api/admin/update` is
//! the exact signed manifest the release tool produced, and this server checks
//! that signature against the same pinned public keys a seat checks it
//! against — the Fleet's key opens the door, it does not vouch for what comes
//! through it. So a Fleet with a compromised shelf can offer only builds that
//! were already signed by the key Creede holds, and every seat in the shop
//! checks the same signature again for itself before running anything. Two
//! independent checks of one signature, neither of them the hub's.
//!
//! The maintenance key is set by whoever runs the server, and until they set
//! one **every route here answers 404**: a shop that has not asked to be looked
//! after does not quietly grow a remote maintenance channel.
