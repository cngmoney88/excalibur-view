//! Where this office stands with Excalibur View Office.
//!
//! Four states, worked out from three settings and the clock:
//!
//! - **founding**: a server that was already in use before licensing existed.
//!   Mesa Fab's and the first customers' servers are these. Every user, every
//!   update, for good, with no file to lose. See [`FOUNDING_BEFORE`].
//! - **licensed**: a signed license file has been added and checks out.
//! - **trial**: the first [`TRIAL_DAYS`] days, with everything on.
//! - **unlicensed**: the trial is over and there is no license. Everything
//!   already on the server can still be opened, printed and exported; only
//!   sharing *new* work through it pauses. Nothing is deleted, and nobody is
//!   signed out.
//!
//! And one more, which only a person can bring about: a licensed server whose
//! program was built after the license's updates ended — a newer version
//! installed by hand, since the server never updates itself past them. It is
//! treated like an ended trial, with the two ways out said plainly: renew, or
//! put back a version the license covers. Everything the license covers keeps
//! working for good, which is the promise on the website; a version it does
//! not cover is not one the office bought.
//!
//! A license is checked here, on the office's own machine, against the keys
//! built into the program. Nothing is sent anywhere to do it.
