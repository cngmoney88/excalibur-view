//! Reaching this server from a jobsite.
//!
//! On the shop network a seat finds its server by shouting on UDP and the
//! server answering. From a truck, a trailer or a hotel it cannot: a broadcast
//! does not cross a router. The answer is an outbound connection from this
//! server to Cloudflare, which then answers on a public hostname — nothing is
//! opened on the shop's firewall, because the connection is made from the
//! inside, the way a browser makes one.
//!
//! **The tunnel belongs to the shop, not to us.** It lives in their own
//! Cloudflare account, on their hostname, made with their token. We cannot
//! reach it, cannot see it and cannot take it away; if they stop paying us it
//! keeps working. That is not generosity, it is the product: this thing is
//! sold on the promise that a shop's drawings stay in the shop's hands, and
//! routing every customer's jobsite traffic through our account would make
//! that untrue in the one place it matters, which is the path the drawings
//! actually travel.
//!
//! **A sealed server never does any of this.** Every outward connection is
//! refused and that is the whole of the edition. The panel says so rather than
//! offering a button that cannot work.
//!
//! What this is not: a VPN. One service is reachable on one hostname — this
//! server's API. Nothing else on the shop's network is behind the tunnel, so
//! nothing else is exposed.
