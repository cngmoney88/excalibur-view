//! Jobs, as another program sees them.
//!
//! An estimating system that sends a bid's drawings here and reads the
//! takeoff back needs four things the viewer never asked for, and each of them
//! is here because the program this replaces got it wrong:
//!
//! - **The same bid is always the same project.** A project can carry a
//!   reference in the other program's terms (`fabwire:bid:2630`), and asking
//!   for a project with a reference that already has one answers with that
//!   one. A push retried after a dropped connection does not make a second job.
//! - **The same drawing is never stored twice.** An upload of bytes the project
//!   already holds answers with the set that holds them. Bluebeam's answer to a
//!   re-push was to delete the file and upload it again, which threw away every
//!   markup on it.
//! - **A drawing issued again replaces the one before, and the takeoff comes
//!   with it.** The new issue supersedes the old; the old is kept, markups and
//!   all. Asked to, the markups are brought forward onto the new issue — sheet
//!   for sheet, only where the sheet is the same size — each one marked
//!   *Carried forward — check* so nobody mistakes a quantity measured on the
//!   last revision for one measured on this.
//! - **A finished bid is put away, not destroyed.** Archiving takes a project
//!   off the list and changes nothing else. It can be brought back.
//!
//! And one thing for keeping up: a stamp that changes whenever anything that
//! would change the takeoff does, so a program can tell "nothing new" from
//! "pull again" without pulling.
