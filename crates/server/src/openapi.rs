const DESCRIPTION: &str = "\
Everything an Excalibur View desktop can do, any other program can do too.

Two things worth knowing before you integrate against this.

**The PDF is the file of record.** A markup on this API is the PDF annotation \
dictionary itself, base64'd — not a summary of one. Anything you read here can \
be written back into the drawing byte for byte, and anything you write here \
lands in the drawing as a real annotation that Bluebeam Revu, Acrobat and any \
other reader will show.

**Nothing is estimated, and you must check for that.** Measuring needs a scale, \
and a sheet does not always have one. A measurement from a sheet with no scale \
comes back with `scaled: false` and every measured field absent — not zero — \
and it is counted in `left_out` and excluded from every total. If `left_out` is \
above zero the totals are short, and `sheets_without_a_scale` names the sheets \
somebody needs to look at. A caller that ignores this will quietly under-report \
a bid.

Weights come from the unit weight carried by the tool that drew the markup, out \
of the tool chest the estimator was using. They are that company's numbers. \
This server does not look anything up in a section table.";
