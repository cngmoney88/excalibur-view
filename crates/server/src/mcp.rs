//! Letting an assistant ask about the quantities.
//!
//! A takeoff is a pile of numbers that somebody has to turn into sentences —
//! how much steel is on this job, what did the last revision cost, which
//! shapes have no weight against them. Those are questions, and the shop
//! already has something that answers questions. This puts the takeoff where
//! it can be asked.
//!
//! It speaks MCP over HTTP: JSON-RPC 2.0 at `/mcp`, with the same bearer token
//! as the rest of the API. Point Claude or anything else that speaks MCP at a
//! shop's own server and it can read that shop's quantities. Bluebeam has
//! nothing of the kind, and could not easily: the numbers only exist inside
//! its own window.
//!
//! # The two rules this endpoint is built on
//!
//! **Everything here is read-only.** There is no tool that draws a markup,
//! changes a scale, edits a takeoff or uploads anything. That is not an
//! oversight to be filled in later — it is the point. A program whose whole
//! argument is that every quantity traces back to something a person clicked
//! must not grow a door through which a language model can click. A test at
//! the bottom of this file fails if a write tool ever appears here.
//!
//! **It answers with the same warnings a person would see.** A takeoff that
//! is short three sheets for want of a scale says so, in the answer, in
//! words — not as a field somebody might not read. An assistant summarising
//! this for somebody has to be told what it does not know, or it will
//! confidently report a total that is missing a floor.

carry into anything you say about these numbers.

A measurement on a sheet with no scale is LEFT OUT of every total and \
reported separately. It is never counted as zero. When an answer says \
measurements were left out, the totals in it are short, and you must say so \
rather than presenting them as the quantity.

A shape with no unit weight in the tool chest has NO weight, which is not a \
weight of zero. Do not fill one in from a section table, your own knowledge, \
or anywhere else. The weights here are this company's own numbers.";
