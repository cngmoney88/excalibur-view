//! The cut list, and what to buy to cut it from.
//!
//! A markups list tells you what was picked up. A shop list tells you what to
//! buy and what to cut, which is a different question and the one a fabricator
//! actually asks. Revu will give you the first and leave you to build the
//! second in a spreadsheet; this is the second, and the nesting underneath it
//! is something Revu has never had at all.
//!
//! What it does: takes every length measurement, groups them by shape, rounds
//! each one **up** to a cutting length, counts how many of each, totals the
//! weight from the unit weight that came off the tool chest, and — when
//! somebody has said what stock length they buy — works out how many sticks
//! that is and what falls on the floor.
//!
//! Four rules, and all four are about not lying to the shop:
//!
//! * **Lengths round up, never down.** A beam measured at 24'-5 7/8" is cut at
//!   24'-6". Rounding a cut length down is how a member arrives short.
//! * **A shape with no unit weight has no weight.** It is listed, with its
//!   lengths and its count, and the weight column says so rather than guessing
//!   at a section's weight from its name.
//! * **Anything off an unscaled sheet is not on the list.** It is reported
//!   separately, because a cut list that quietly dropped six members is worse
//!   than one that says six are missing.
//! * **Nothing is nested until somebody says what the stock is.** There is no
//!   default mill length in here. A piece longer than the stock is named as
//!   one that will not come out of it, not quietly packed into a stick that
//!   cannot hold it.
