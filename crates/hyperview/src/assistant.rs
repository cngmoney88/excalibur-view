//! Claude, on this computer: reading the office's takeoffs, and working the
//! Hyperview window alongside the person at it.
//!
//! Claude Desktop runs its connectors as programs on the same computer and
//! talks to them over standard input and output — so this program is that
//! connector too. Started with `--mcp`, Hyperview has no window. It answers
//! Claude with two kinds of tool:
//!
//! - **The office's**, passed through to the office server's `/mcp` with a key
//!   that can do nothing but ask: the jobs, the sets, the quantities, what a
//!   revision cost. Read-only, by design (see `hyperview_server::mcp`).
//! - **The window's**, answered through the desk ([`crate::desk`]): what is
//!   open, the words and the picture of a sheet, turning to a sheet, pointing
//!   at markups, running the office's checks — and *proposing* markups, which
//!   appear in the window with a Fix button and are drawn only when the person
//!   clicks it.
//!
//! "Connect Claude" in the Help menu does the setting up: it asks the server
//! for the key, keeps it beside the program, and adds Hyperview to Claude
//! Desktop's list of connectors — both places Claude Desktop keeps that list
//! on Windows, because the Store version reads a different one from the one
//! its own Edit Config button opens. Nobody edits a file.
//!
//! # When it does not work
//!
//! Every start of the connector, and every question Claude asks it, is
//! written to `claude-bridge.log` beside the program. "Test Claude Connection"
//! in the Help menu reads that log, checks both settings files, and runs the
//! connector itself the way Claude would — so the answer to "it didn't seem to
//! work" is a report, not a guess. The three things that actually go wrong:
//! Claude Desktop was not quit from the tray and reopened (it reads its list
//! only when it starts), a settings file it could not read (a byte-order mark
//! left by Notepad or PowerShell), and a kept-alive connection to an office
//! server that has since restarted.

weights come with them, and say in `why` what you saw that makes you propose it.

A sheet with no scale has no measurements in any total. When window_status \
says the sheet has none and the title block or view title gives one, propose \
the scale (kind scale) before proposing lengths or areas on that sheet. A wrong \
