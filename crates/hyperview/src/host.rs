//! Hosting the company's server on this computer.
//!
//! Somebody has to be the server, and in a six-person shop that somebody is a
//! computer already sitting in the office. Asking them to find a Linux box,
//! install a runtime and run a command is asking them not to bother.
//!
//! So this program is the server. It is the same binary either way: started
//! normally it is the viewer, started with `--serve` it is the server, and the
//! "host the drawings on this computer" button does both at once — serves right
//! now from inside the running program, and arranges for it to keep serving
//! after the machine is rebooted.
//!
//! One thing this deliberately does **not** claim to do: install itself onto
//! somebody else's machine. Nothing can put software on a server it has no
//! account on, and a program that offered to would be lying. What it does
//! instead is be the thing that needed installing — and once it is running,
//! every other seat in the building finds it without anybody typing an address.
