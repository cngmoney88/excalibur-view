/// office's machines. A key here can make a licence file and that is all. No
/// release, plugin or update is ever checked against this list; only the
/// server's licence check reads it, and it reads [`KEYS`] too, so every
/// licence signed on the PC before this list existed still checks out.
///
/// If one of these ever leaked, the harm is free licences, not software on
/// somebody's machine. The fix is a new key here in the next release and the
/// old one's licences signed again, which their servers fetch by themselves.

/// finishes a bid has made a decision, and a program that went round the back

/// not a tool chest, not a name. And what arrives is checked against [`KEYS`]

/// something the program trusts — a feed that was taken over could serve only
/// things that were already signed by a key its publisher holds.

/// fetch that license and nothing else.
///
/// Three things this deliberately is not. It is **not an account**: no
/// password, no session, nothing to reset, nothing to keep running. It is
/// **not a check-in**: the server asks for a file and sends nothing about
/// itself, not a seat count, not a company name, not a drawing. And it is
/// **not how a license takes effect** — what arrives is checked against
/// [`KEYS`] exactly like an update, and a file that is not signed, or is
/// worse than the one already held, is ignored.
///
/// A sealed office never asks: the request goes through the same outbound
/// gate as everything else, and its licenses arrive as files, by hand, the way
/// that office wants everything to arrive.

/// every part of this worked and none of it ran.

/// that has to be fetchable by name over HTTPS with no login, and that is all
/// it has to be. Nothing here is trusted because of where it came from: what

/// so this address is a place to fetch from and not a thing the server
/// believes.
