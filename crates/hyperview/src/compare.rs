//! Comparing two issues of the same sheet, and laying one over the other.
//!
//! This is the thing a fabricator opens Revu for the morning a revision
//! arrives: Rev 2 of S-201 is on the desk and the only question is *what moved*.
//! A cloud round every change is worth an hour of squinting.
//!
//! How it works, and what it will not do.
//!
//! Both issues are rendered to ink at the same size and compared pixel by
//! pixel. Ink that is in one and not the other is a change. Changed pixels are
//! then grown into rectangles, because a person wants "this detail changed", not
//! four thousand dots.
//!
//! **It does not measure anything.** A comparison points at a region; it never
//! reports a length, an area or a weight for it. Two issues of a sheet can be at
//! different scales, the second can be a scan, and a number derived from a
//! difference between two rasters would be a guess with a decimal point on it.
//! Somebody looks at what changed and measures it with a tool, which is the
//! same rule as everywhere else: every quantity traces to a click.
//!
//! **It says when it could not line them up.** Two issues are often shifted by
//! a few thousandths — a different plotter, a re-scan, a title block that grew.
//! Comparing without correcting for that marks the entire sheet as changed,
//! which is worse than useless because it looks like an answer. So the offset is
//! found first, and if no offset makes the two agree, that is reported instead
//! of a page full of clouds.
