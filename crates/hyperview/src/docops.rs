//! Document operations: what Revu's Document menu does.
//!
//! Combining, splitting, extracting, inserting, deleting, rotating, cropping,
//! labelling, stamping headers and footers, slip-sheeting a revision, and
//! flattening markups into the page.
//!
//! Two rules run through every one of them.
//!
//! **Nothing is done in place.** Every operation writes a new file and leaves
//! the one it read alone. A drawing set is the file of record for a bid, and a
//! program that rewrites one because somebody chose the wrong menu item has
//! destroyed the only copy of what was actually issued. Where a name would
//! collide, a number is added rather than anything being overwritten.
//!
//! **Markups travel or they are reported.** The markups are real PDF
//! annotations on those pages, so pages copied between files carry them. Where
//! an operation cannot carry them — and there is exactly one, flattening, which
//! turns them into paint on purpose — it is said plainly before it runs.
