//! Talking to a Hyperview server, without ever making the window wait.
//!
//! Everything here happens on its own thread and reports back through a
//! channel. A drawing set is sixty megabytes and a shop's network is a shop's
//! network; a viewer that stops painting while a file comes down is a viewer
//! somebody stops using.
//!
//! The whole thing is optional. Hyperview opens a drawing off a disk and saves
//! markups into it with no server anywhere, and a server that has gone away
//! mid-session costs the user nothing but the sync.
