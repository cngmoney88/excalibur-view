//! from this camera, this big, looking like this. The drawing happens on the
//! view's own graphics device and comes back as pixels, so it doesn't matter
//! which renderer the window itself runs on, the window never waits on it,
//! and a picture for a brochure at twice the size of the screen is the same
//! call with bigger numbers. A click is answered with the part under it.
