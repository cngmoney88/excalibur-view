//! The sandbox a plugin runs in, shared by the program and the office server.
//!
//! A seat runs an office's plugins itself. A copy of Excalibur View that isn't
//! allowed to run code it downloads (the Mac App Store edition) asks its office
//! server to run them instead, and the server runs them here, in exactly the
//! same interpreter with exactly the same limits, so a plugin says the same
//! thing wherever it runs.
//!
//! A module that imports anything at all is refused: there is nothing for it
//! to import. It gets a budget of work and of memory, and running out of either
//! is an error, not a hang.
