//! Finding the company's server without anybody typing an address.
//!
//! The first person in a shop sets a server up. Everybody else just opens the
//! program, and it should already be offering them "Mesa Fab — 12 drawing sets"
//! to click. Asking an estimator for an IP address is asking them to go and
//! find somebody who knows one.
//!
//! So a server answers for itself on the local network: a seat shouts once, and
//! anything that is a Hyperview server says what it is called and where it is.
//! Plain UDP on one port — no service to install, no name server to configure,
//! nothing that stops working when a shop's IT changes something.
//!
//! Three things this deliberately does not do.
//!
//! It is **not a way in.** A reply says only what a server calls itself and
//! where to find it; every question after that needs signing in, so answering
//! gives away nothing that browsing to the address would not.
//!
//! It **never leaves the building.** Broadcast traffic does not cross a router,
//! which means a shop's server does not announce itself to the internet, and a
//! seat cannot accidentally find somebody else's.
//!
//! And an answer is **an offer, not an instruction.** What comes back is shown
//! to the person to choose from. A machine on the network claiming to be a
//! server is not a reason to trust it with a password, so the address is always
//! visible before anybody types one.
