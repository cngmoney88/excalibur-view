//! The Hyperview wire model: what a desktop, a self-hosted server and anybody
//! else's integration all agree on.
//!
//! Two rules shape everything here.
//!
//! **The PDF is still the file of record.** The server holds the drawing and a
//! stream of markups, and a markup on the wire is the *annotation dictionary
//! itself*, not some summary of it. Anything that came out of a drawing can be
//! put back into that drawing byte for byte. There is no lossy middle format
//! for fidelity to leak out of.
//!
//! **Nothing is estimated, on the wire either.** A quantity crossing this API
//! carries whether its sheet had a scale. A sheet with no scale reports its
//! measurements as unscaled and leaves them out of the totals, exactly as the
//! viewer does, so an integration cannot accidentally read a missing scale as
//! a zero.
