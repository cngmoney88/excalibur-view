//! The publisher's release feed.
//!
//! One place on the internet says what the newest Hyperview is: a releases
//! page on GitHub, where each release carries the two programs and a
//! `release.json` describing them, each description signed by the key Creede
//! holds. A company's server reads it and passes new versions on to its own
//! seats; a seat with no server reads it for itself.
//!
//! Nothing here decides whether a build is trustworthy. This only fetches.
//! What arrives is checked against the keys compiled into the running program
//! by [`crate::update::Trusted::check`] before anything is done with it, so a
//! feed that was taken over could serve only builds that were already signed
//! by the publisher's own key.
//!
//! Nothing goes the other way. The feed is asked what exists and is sent
//! nothing about who is asking: not a company name, not a drawing, not a count
//! of seats.
