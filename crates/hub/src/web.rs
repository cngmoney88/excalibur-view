//! How this program reaches anything over HTTPS.
//!
//! A connection trusts two lists of certificate authorities at once: the one
//! built into the program, and the one Windows keeps.
//!
//! The built-in list alone fails on a PC whose antivirus or office firewall
//! looks inside secure connections. Avast, ESET, Kaspersky, Bitdefender and
//! most office firewalls do it by presenting a certificate of their own,
//! which they added to Windows' list and nobody else's — so a program that
//! only knows the built-in list refuses every connection, the update check
//! included, and says nothing a person could act on.
//!
//! Windows' list alone fails on a freshly installed server, which fetches the
//! authorities it needs only when something asks it to and may not have
//! GitHub's yet.
//!
//! Both lists together, and neither of those happens. What is trusted is still
//! only a certificate authority someone chose to trust; and an update is
//! checked against the publisher's key regardless, so the connection was never
//! what made a download safe to run.
