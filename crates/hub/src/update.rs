//! Updates.
//!
//! One place publishes, everybody pulls from their own server, and nothing
//! installs that was not signed by the key the publisher holds.
//!
//! The shape of it:
//!
//! 1. A tag on the private repository builds the installer and signs a
//!    [`Release`] describing it. The signing key never leaves the publisher.
//! 2. A company's own Hyperview server offers that release at
//!    `/api/v1/update/latest`, either mirroring the published feed or serving
//!    a file an administrator uploaded by hand — a shop with no internet on
//!    the floor can still be updated.
//! 3. A seat checks on start, downloads in the background, checks the digest
//!    **and** the signature against a key compiled into the running program,
//!    and installs on the next launch. Never in the middle of a session:
//!    somebody three hours into a takeoff does not get restarted.
//!
//! Two things a shop needs that a consumer app does not:
//!
//! - **Pinning.** An administrator can hold every seat on one version. A
//!   fabricator in the middle of a bid package should not have the tool that
//!   priced the first half behave differently on the second.
//! - **Staging.** A release is not offered until it is marked ready, so one
//!   seat can try it before the other five get it.

// none of it needs macOS to compile -- `ditto`, `codesign` and `xattr` are
// names of programs, not system calls. Built everywhere, it can be tested
// everywhere, and the parts that decide whether a download is fit to install
// are exactly the parts worth testing.
//
// A Mac program is not a file. It is a folder -- `Excalibur View.app` -- with
// a signature over everything in it, symbolic links inside it that have to
// survive being copied, and a quarantine mark macOS puts on anything that came
// off the internet. Writing over the executable inside it, the way
// [`swap_in`] does on Windows, breaks the signature and macOS then refuses to
// open it at all. So the whole folder is replaced at once.
//
// Three of macOS's own tools do the parts that must be done exactly right:
//
// - `ditto` unpacks the zip. An ordinary unzip flattens the symbolic links a
//   bundle keeps in `Contents/Frameworks` and strips extended attributes, and
//   either one invalidates the signature.
// - `codesign` says whether the unpacked bundle is really signed and whole.
//   We have already checked it against our own key by this point; this is
//   macOS's own opinion, asked separately, so a bundle that would not open
//   is found here rather than after it has replaced the working one.
// - `xattr` takes the quarantine mark off, which is what otherwise produces
//   "downloaded from the internet, are you sure" on a version the person did
//   not download and never saw arrive.
