//! Chests from outside this repository, read the way the program reads them.
//!
//! The six trade chests are made from data that does not live here and must
//! not — they are the thing being sold — so this asks for them rather than
//! carrying them:
//!
//! ```text
//! EXCALIBUR_TEST_CHESTS=/somewhere/chests cargo test -p chest --test real_chests
//! ```
//!
//! With the variable unset every test here says so and passes. A test that
//! fails on every machine but one is a test people learn to ignore.
//!
//! What it is for: parsing a chest and loading a chest are not the same
//! thing. `load_chest_from` parses the file, writes it back out in Excalibur
//! View's own format, and then reads the seat's whole arrangement off disk
//! again — and it is that second reading, not the first, that decides what
//! somebody sees on the toolbar. A chest that parses and then loses its
//! weights on the way back out would look fine in every test that stops
//! after the first step.
